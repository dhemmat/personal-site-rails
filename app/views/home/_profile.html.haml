        %p I enjoy challenges and regularly look into learning new technologies. My go-to platform for development is Rails as I have become very experienced in it and I am able to deliver high quality code and functionality very rapidly. I am currently working on improving my Angular.js skills, and I am actively working on a number of personal and professional development projects.
